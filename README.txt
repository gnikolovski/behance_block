##INTRODUCTION

The Behance Block Drupal 8 module allows you to pull content from Behance and
display projects on your own website. Behance is the leading online platform to
showcase creative work, and by using this module you will get access to the data
behind millions of projects. Since Behance limits API calls, this module stores
retrieved data in the 'cache' file. The cache file is updated every 24 hours.

##REQUIREMENTS

None.

##INSTALLATION

1. Install the module as usual.
2. Go to "Extend" and enable the Behance Block module.

##CONFIGURATION

In order to get access to the Behance Block you need a unique API key. Go to
(https://www.behance.net/dev/register), and register your app. After that, go to
"Configuration" -> "WEB SERVICES" -> "Behance Block" and enter your API key and
portfolio owner's Username or ID.

##USING THE MODULE

1. Create a basic page.
2. Add a Behance Block to this page by going to "Structure" -> "Block layout"
