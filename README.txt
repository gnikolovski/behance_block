INTRODUCTION
------------

The Behance API Drupal 8 module allows you to pull content from Behance and
display projects on your own website. Behance is the leading online platform to
showcase creative work, and by using this module you will get access to the data
behind millions of projects. Since Behance limits API calls, this module stores
retrieved data in the 'cache' file. The cache file is updated every 24 hours.

None.


INSTALLATION

2. Go to "Extend" and enable the Behance API module.

portfolio owner's Username or ID.
